Reverse Integer
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed.
If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).


Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:
Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Constraints:
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Length of Last Word
Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces,
return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.
