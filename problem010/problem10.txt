Add Strings
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger).
You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

Example 1:
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"

Example 2:
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"

Example 3:
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
 

Constraints:
1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10^4
num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
